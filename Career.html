            <p>A web designers job is pretty important as they are responsible for the creation and maintaining of websites. 
                They are often payed by companies to code a website to their liking including in all aspects such as logos colour, 
                photos, multiple pages and info. They do alot of similar stuff that we do in this class writing HTML, css, and Java Script
                to design and create webpages. It is a job that requires lots of technological skill in computer programming and web design.
                In Canada the average yearly salary is $50,000 with new coming positions being around $38,000 yearly and higher level 
                workers making +$65,000 a year.</p>

            <p>If I was to follow a career in web design I would choose to go to McMaster University. They have a course for web design
            where they teach you professional design and business skills which can be useful if creating a business or looking for business.
            You learn about running self-employed business and the marketing, public & personal relations, customer research and fundamentals of 
            running your own business, web page or app. When I go to post secondary I plan on living in residence so that plus the estimate cost 
            of the course would be around $16,500 ($8,500 for residence and $8,000 for the course.) You could also do the course entirely from 
            home.
