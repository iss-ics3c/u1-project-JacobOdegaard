        <p>My name is Jacob Odegaard and I am a 16 year old student attending Innisdale Secondary School. I enjoy playing video 
            games and various sports with my friends in my spare time. Aside from school I work at McDonald's and like to go shopping 
            with the money I make. I consider myself to be a fan of technology and the ways its evolved in the recent years. This is 
            why I chose to do this course because technology is the future and there may be many jobs created through technology.</p>

        <P>I also enjoy traveling, fishing, and exploring. I have been to places such as British Columbia, New Brunswick, Arizona, Florida, Cuba and Costa Rica.
        I love to try and do new things in places that are totally different than here at home so we do activities like
        hiking, zip lining, tours, scuba diving and more while traveling as a family.</P>
